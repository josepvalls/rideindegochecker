Checker for RideIndego Webservice

Tired of having to walk home because there are no bikes available anymore I wrote a little script to fetch the API and see how many bikes are available in the stations closer to me. 
I started with a CLI Python script checking the webservice periodically but I ran into RUMPS and I added a menu item that is much more visible.
